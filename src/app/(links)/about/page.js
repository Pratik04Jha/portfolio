      "Akash Model School has been more than just an institution — it's been a long, drawn-out endurance test disguised as education. From outdated teaching methods to a near-complete absence of creativity, the system prioritizes rote memorization over understanding, obedience over curiosity, and conformity over skill development. Despite this, the experience has instilled in me a deep appreciation for independent thinking, self-learning, and the value of true education — the kind that isn't confined to textbooks or limited by rigid rules. It taught me how to question the system, adapt on my own, and cultivate resilience in a place where mediocrity is celebrated and innovation is often silenced. My time here didn't just teach me what I want to learn — it made it clear what I refuse to become.",

          Hey, I’m Pratik — a creator, explorer, and tech enthusiast obsessed
          with turning ideas into reality. My journey began with curiosity and a
          keyboard, and ever since, I’ve been diving into everything from web
          development and game design to experimenting with new tech. I don’t
          just build for the sake of it — I build to learn, grow, and push the
          boundaries of what’s possible. Every bug I fix, every game I release,
          every project I launch — it’s all part of the thrill. This arcade is
          more than just games — it’s a piece of my journey, and it’s only
          getting started.
